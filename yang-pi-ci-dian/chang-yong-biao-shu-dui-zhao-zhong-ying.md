### ~~我认为这就是一种艺术！~~

### [常见瑕疵](https://vcb-s.com/archives/4738)

### 总评画质

For Season 1 / The MOVIE / This Season / The Source

极佳 has an excellent image quality

挺好 is fine / is of good quality / is pretty well&#x20;

一般 is relatively acceptable / is of (nothing special / mid quality / average level)&#x20;

拉跨 is quite terrible / is below average

### 描述细节

晕轮，锯齿和模糊 ringing, aliasing and blurring&#x20;

有轻微的色带 have slight banding&#x20;

线条有 轻微/较严重 的 锯齿/晕轮 the lines have slight/conspicuous aliasing/ringing

有明显瑕疵的线条 the lines with obvious imperfections&#x20;

线条锐利纹理丰富 with sharp lines and rich texture&#x20;

平面噪点的质量不高 the noise in the flat area is not of high quality&#x20;

使用了非常劣质的拉伸算法 upscaled by a very poor algorithm&#x20;

由低分辨率缩放导致 caused by low-resolution upscaling / caused by upscaling from low resolution&#x20;

导致部分场景显得十分难看 make some scenes very dirty

### 处理手段

**使用基于生成对抗网络的动漫图像超分辨率模型 RealCUGAN-Pro (Real Cascade U-Nets Generative Adversarial Networks) 超分辨率至2160P Upscale to 2160P with RealCUGAN-Pro(AI Super Resolution Model for Anime Images Based on Generative Adversarial Networks)**

本次制作仍然采用常规处理 and this time we still use routine processing / treat it with some mild regular processing / apply conservative processing&#x20;

加上了一定强度的噪点以改善观感 add some grains to improve the viewing exprience&#x20;

进行了自适应锐化与降噪 perform adaptive sharpening and denoising&#x20;

去除严重的锯齿 to remove serious aliasing&#x20;

使用了常规的抗锯齿、去色带和去晕轮 apply routine anti-aliasing, de-banding, as well as de-ringing

**在超分辨率和画面风格的保护间达到了很好的平衡 achieve a good balance between picture style preservation and Super-Resolution**
